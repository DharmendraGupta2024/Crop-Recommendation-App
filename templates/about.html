    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering, I have hands-on experience in full-stack development. I am skilled in building responsive, high-performance web applications using front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and optimizing them through effective API integration.
      <br /><br />
      This project particularly showcases my passion for applying machine learning to build intelligent solutions. I have practical experience with Python and its data science ecosystem, including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, and in deploying predictive models on the web using the Flask framework.
      <br /><br />
      I am seeking to contribute my technical proficiency and innovative thinking to a dynamic software development role that bridges the gap between modern web technology and data-driven insights.
